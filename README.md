# 								Jobji

**Jobji** - name of project about job.

This is really better version of this [github]: https://github.com/DenisB7/stepik_chapter3 and this one [github]: https://github.com/DenisB7/stepik_chapter-4

This project was a homework of course from [Stepik]: https://stepik.org/


I've spent a lot of time refactoring this project and it worth it.

I'm new in Django and programming, and always trying to improve my skills.
