This is really better version of this (project was implemented in 2 parts) [github]: https://github.com/DenisB7/stepik_chapter3 (beggining) and this one [github]: https://github.com/DenisB7/stepik_chapter-4 (continue)

**This project was a homework of course** from [Stepik]: https://stepik.org/


I've spent a lot of time refactoring this project and it worth it.

I'm always trying to improve my skills.
